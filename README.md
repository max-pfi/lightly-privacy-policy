# Privacy Policy
Your privacy is very important to us, and this privacy policy explains how the Lightly App manages your data.

In short, we don't collect any kind of data, and nothing that you enter ever leaves the app (unless you explicitly export a backup, in which case you, as the user, have full control over the destination of the export). When using the links provided in the app to send us an email or a message via Telegram, this will forward you to the respective applications from which you can contact us if you choose to do so. Both the collected information and the use thereof are detailed below.

## Collection of Information
### Information you provide to us
Email address (when you, as the user, explicitly contact us via Email)

Telephone Number (when you, as the user, explicitly contact us via Telegram)
## Use of Information
Neither email addresses nor telephone numbers are stored anywhere outside of the application with which we receive the messages. The messages themselves are not saved outside those applications either. Both email and telephone numbers will only ever be used to reply to direct questions, and never to message you about anything else (news, updates, etc.).

## Data Transfer
Data is not transferred in any way other than by your email client or Telegram, for which you can consult their respective privacy policy terms.

## Data Retention
We retain personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purposes of answering your requests.

## Data Subject Requests
To have your personal information removed, you can simply write us an email at lightly.mindfulness.app@gmail.com with your request. We will delete your phone number/email from our communication tools and also all messages that have been sent. To delete your personal data in the app, it is sufficient to delete your app or app data on your phoneâ€”as mentioned above, no app data ever leaves your phone.

## Requested Permissions
For some functionalities, this app uses permissions. Here is a list of the permissions and why they are needed:

`Permission WAKE_LOCK`: This permission is needed to keep the screen on while doing a breathing exercise or a meditation.

`Permission VIBRATE`: This permission is needed to vibrate the phone when an alarm goes off.

`Permission RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`: This permission is needed to allow the app to complete tasks after your device has been restarted.

`Permission SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`: This permission is needed to schedule alarms that you set yourself.

`Permission WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`: This permission is needed to export the data you explicitly want to export or to import audio files and images that you explicitly want to import.
